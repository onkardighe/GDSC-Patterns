An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).

write program for
Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.

Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.

```
Example 1:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Possible Answer: 2

Generated Output: 1

Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.
If 2 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.

```

```
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {3,4}
Possible Answer: 1

Output: 1

Explanation: 4 (at index 1) is the 
peak element as it is greater than 
its only neighbour element 3.
If 1 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.
